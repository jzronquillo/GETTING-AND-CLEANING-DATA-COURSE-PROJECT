##### 2. run_analysis.R, the R script that was used to create the data set 
#####  run_analysis.R does the following:
##### a. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##### b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
##### c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

#####       * prefix f is replaced by frequency
#####        * Mag is replaced by Magnitude
#####        * BodyBody is replaced by Body
##### e. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
